[SUMMARY]{}

</div>

<div class="sectionContent">

[I'm an engineer with a passion for developing scientific software
applications to help solve some of the most pressing problems facing our
world. My particular interest lies in applied optimization and towards
this end I am pursuing a graduate degree, part-time, with a focus on
Computational Engineering. I have a broad technical background developed
through work in both academic and industrial organizations, providing
both research-oriented and commercially-focused products and services.
As such, I am extremely comfortable communicating within a variety of
environments and have a proven ability to adapt to changing
responsibilities based on evolving project requirements.]{}

-   Developing the next-generation orbit propagator for controls design
    and Vehicle Hardware Lab simulation as well as the on-board flight
    software orbit estimation Kalman filter.
-   Collaboratively building a Git submodule-based simulation
    architecture to enable code reuse and standardization for the
    Mathworks environment.
-   Devised a package management system to automatically check and load
    necessary library dependencies for simulation submodules.
-   Implementing Mathworks-based autocode generation toolchain to help
    streamline flight software build efforts.
-   Produced new, Jupyter and Julia-based mission analysis tools for the
    NASA [Restore-L](https://sspd.gsfc.nasa.gov/restore-L.html)mission
    to help guide hardware subsystems decision-making which included a
    sensor placement optimization and visualization tool.
-   Expanded verification and validation test routines for
    Chebyshev-based ephemeris approximation code.
-   Founding member of the Guidance, Navigation and Control Software
    Development Working Group which formed consensus-based guidelines
    for code commonly utilized by multiple departments.
-   Designed and conducted critical orbit-raising maneuvers as the
    Mission Planner for more than five geosynchronous communication
    programs.
-   Developed training for new Orbit Dynamics Group hires in using the
    heritage mission analysis tool set.
