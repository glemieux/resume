I'm an engineer with a passion for developing scientific software applications to help solve some of the most pressing problems facing our world. My particular interest lies in applied optimization and towards this end I am pursuing a graduate degree, part-time, with a focus on Computational Engineering. I have a broad technical background developed through work in both academic and industrial organizations, providing both research-oriented and commercially-focused products and services. As such, I am extremely comfortable communicating within a variety of environments and have a proven ability to adapt to changing responsibilities based on evolving project requirements.

## EMPLOYMENT

### *Systems Engineering Specialist*, [[SSL](http://sslmda.com)](http://sslmda.com) (2012-04 — Present)


  - Developing the next-generation orbit propagator for controls design and Vehicle Hardware Lab simulation as well as the on-board flight software orbit estimation Kalman filter.
  - Collaboratively building a Git submodule-based simulation architecture to enable code reuse and standardization for the Mathworks environment.
  - Devised a package management system to automatically check and load necessary library dependencies for simulation submodules.
  - Implementing Mathworks-based autocode generation toolchain to help streamline flight software build efforts.
  - Produced new, Jupyter and Julia-based mission analysis tools for the NASA [Restore-L](https://sspd.gsfc.nasa.gov/restore-L.html) mission to help guide hardware subsystems decision-making which included a sensor placement optimization and visualization tool.
  - Expanded verification and validation test routines for Chebyshev-based ephemeris approximation code.
  - Founding member of the Guidance, Navigation and Control Software Development Working Group which formed consensus-based guidelines for code commonly utilized by multiple departments.
  - Designed and conducted critical orbit-raising maneuvers as the Mission Planner for more than five geosynchronous communication programs.
  - Developed training for new Orbit Dynamics Group hires in using the heritage mission analysis tool set.

### *Research and Development Engineer*, [[Space Science Laboratory](http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)](http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/) (2008-06 — 2012-04)
