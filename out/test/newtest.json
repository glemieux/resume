    "brief": "I'm an engineer with a passion for developing scientfic software applications to help solve some of the most pressing problems our world faces.  My particular interest lies in applied optimization problems and towards this end I am pursuing a graduate degree, part-time, with a focus on Computational Engineering.  I have a broad technical background developed through work in both academic and industrial organizations, providing both research-oriented and commericially-focused products and services.  As such, I am extremely comfortable communicating within a variety of environments and have a proven ability to adapt to changing responsibilities based on evolving project requirements."
